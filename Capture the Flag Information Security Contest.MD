## Capture The Flag Information Security Contest
- Capture the flag (CTF) is a cybersecurity competition that is used test and develop computer security skills. It was first developed in 1996 at DEF CON, the largest cybersecurity conference in the United States hosted annually in Las Vegas, Nevada.

- In a CTF, participants are given a set of challenges that they must solve in order to collect "flags". Flags are typically text strings that are hidden in purposefully-vulnerable programs or websites. The goal of the competition is to collect as many flags as possible in a given amount of time.

- CTFs can be divided into two main categories: attack/defense and jeopardy. In attack/defense CTFs, participants are divided into two teams: attackers and defenders. The attackers attempt to hack into the defenders' systems and steal their flags, while the defenders attempt to protect their systems from attack. In jeopardy CTFs, participants are presented with a series of challenges that they must solve in order to collect flags.

- CTFs are a great way to learn about cybersecurity and to test your skills against other participants. They are also a lot of fun! If you are interested in learning more about CTFs, there are a number of resources available online.



## Here are some of the benefits of participating in CTFs:

- Learn about cybersecurity: CTFs are a great way to learn about different aspects of cybersecurity, such as vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, and forensics.
- Test your skills: CTFs are a great way to test your skills against other participants and to see how you stack up.
- Have fun: CTFs are a lot of fun! They are a great way to learn and to meet other people who are interested in cybersecurity.
