## Cybersecurity

- Cybersecurity is the practice of defending computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from malicious attacks. It's also known as information technology security or electronic information security.

- The goal of cybersecurity is to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. Confidentiality means that only authorized people can access the information. Integrity means that the information cannot be modified without authorization. Availability means that the information is accessible when it is needed.

## There are many different threats to cybersecurity, including:

- Malware: Malware is software that is designed to harm a computer system. Malware can take many forms, including viruses, worms, trojans, and ransomware.
- Phishing: Phishing is a type of social engineering attack that involves sending emails or text messages that appear to be from a legitimate source. The goal of phishing is to trick the recipient into revealing personal information, such as their username and password.
- Data breaches: A data breach is an incident in which sensitive data is exposed to unauthorized individuals. Data breaches can occur through a variety of means, such as hacking, malware, or human error.
  
There are a number of things that can be done to protect against cybersecurity threats, including:

- Use strong passwords: Passwords should be at least 12 characters long and include a mix of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
Be careful about what links you click on: If you receive an email or text message with a link, be sure to hover over the link before clicking on it. This will show you the actual URL of the link, which can help you to determine if it is legitimate.
- Keep your software up to date: Software updates often include security patches that can help to protect your computer from known vulnerabilities.
- Use a firewall: A firewall is a software program that helps to protect your computer from unauthorized access.
- Back up your data: Regularly backing up your data will help to protect you in the event of a data breach.
 -Cybersecurity is an important issue that everyone should be aware of. By taking some simple steps, you can help to protect yourself and your organization from cybersecurity threats.
